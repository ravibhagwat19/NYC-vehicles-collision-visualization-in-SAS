# NYC-vehicles-collision-visualization-in-SAS
As the most populated city in the United States, New York City is also the most traffic-congested city in the US. With such a high volume of traffic and the city plan of NYC, there are a lot of vehicle collisions happening on a daily basis. According to statistics collected by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), there were 228,048 accidents reported in 2018; that’s 19,000 accidents per month and 1 vehicle accident every 2 minutes. A survey done by AllState Insurance back in 2014 revealed that NYC drivers were 28.8% more likely to be in a vehicle accident than the national average. These statistics, along with the constant complaints of traffic by one of our team members who frequently travels to NYC, intrigued our interest to find out the reasons. We brainstormed the possibilities of an accident and also did some relevant research. Interestingly, we have found that ‘Distracted Driving’ tops the list. In order to assess how serious the situation is, our group employs different types of data to have a correct view with a good amount of supporting evidence.
